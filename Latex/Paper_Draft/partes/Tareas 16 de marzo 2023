- Hoy en día hay una vigorosa formación de agua fría profunda en el Atlántico Norte mientras que apenas una ligera ventilación en el Pacífico Norte. 
- Proxies indican que durante el periodo glacial había una mayor formación de agua intermedia pero datos de utilización de nutrientes y proxies de productividad muestran que hubo poco suministro de nutrientes, es decir, poca ventilación y por tanto un océano más estratifica en este sector (NP). 
- Durante el LGM el NP bajo los 2000 m. muestra poca ventilación pero sobre los 2000 muestra un incremento de la ventilación. This suggests a substantial increase in North Pacific Intermediate Water (NPIW) formation at the LGM (6). 
- la fuente local de agua intermedia en el PN es soportada por los datos. 
- SSTs in the subtropical gyre are cooler at the LGM, as expected for glacial conditions, and there is a large midlatitude cooling due to the southward expansion of the subpolar gyre (Fig. 2C and fig. S4)}(22).

-  All data poleward of 40°N indicate a reduction in glacial export productivity (Fig. 2B and
fig. S1B). However, tracers of nutrient utilization (e.g., 15N) suggest  that biological nutrient drawdown was more complete (15). For more complete nutrient drawdown to be achieved despite reduced export productivity, the pool of available major nutrients (phosphate, nitrate, and silicic acid) must have been smaller (1, 15). 
-Today we have two realizations of basin-scale nutrient dynamics and circulation at high northern latitudes: The Pacific is stratified and poorly ventilated, with cold, fresh, and nutrient-rich surface waters, supplied by upwelling of old, nutrient-rich waters from below, while the Atlantic is well ventilated, with a vigorous overturning circulation that flushes warm, salty, and nutrient-poor waters from the subtropics through its upper reaches. At the LGM, our data show that the North Pacific was better ventilated, had lower nutrients, and was saltier and warmer.

- We consider that POC and PICfluxes were derived mainly from biological production in thesurface water at or around the study site.
- Export of POC and PIC from the surface water affects surface waterpCO2and, consequently, CO2exchange with the atmosphere. We therefore examined the effects of POC export as a CO2drawdown(the so‐called“biological pump”) and PIC export as a CO2source (the so‐called“carbonate counterpump”).

Deep Equatorial Pacifc Ocean Oxygenation and Atmospheric CO2 Over The Last Ice Age

Like the Southern Ocean, the eastern equatorial Pacifc Ocean (EEP) plays an important role in the global carbon cycle. Today, although the EEP is the major source of oceanic CO2 outgassed to the atmosphere8, approximately 5–10% of annual global export production occurs there9. Tus, although the EEP is a net CO2 source to the atmosphere today, it could easily have been a CO2 sink in the past, for example, if sequestering of CO2 by the biological pump were more efcient
A slowdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)12 during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and Heinrich Stadial (HS) 1 is coincident with the shifing of wind belts, specifcally the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and the westerlies of both hemispheres13.
At ~6° N, site 8JC is at a position slightly south of the average annual modern-day ITCZ (~7° N16). Using the dust fux record from 17JC, it was hypothesized that increases in dust fux, coincident with the timing of several HS events, were likely associated with shifs in the ITCZ, such that the ITCZ was centered on or south of the equator during each HS event11. Tis reasoning was based on the similar ITCZ shifs hypothesized to explain records near or on the South American continent. T
